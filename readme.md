# AutoTrans
This addon will watch for [[ ]] brackets in any typed command and replace them with the auto-translate equivalent.<br>
Input text must be in English for the time being, though I aim to support Japanese eventually.<br><br>

# Generating Updated Mapping
AutoTrans ships with a current version of the mapping, extracted from my own game files. But, you can also use the command `/at generate` to create a new mapping in your config folder. This will be loaded before the one bundled with the addon if it exists, and you can use it to create your own shorthand by changing the keys if you desire.
